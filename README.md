## üìñ Topics Covered

This documentation covers the following key TypeScript concepts:

1. **Variables and Basic Types**:

   - Learn about declaring variables with specific types like `number`, `string`, etc.
   - Example code demonstrating how TypeScript enforces types to catch errors early.

2. **Enums**:

   - Understand how to define a set of named constants using Enums in TypeScript.
   - Both numeric and string-based Enums are covered.

3. **Functions**:

   - Explore how functions in TypeScript can have return types and optional parameters.
   - Examples of function implementations with and without optional parameters.

4. **Objects and Readonly Properties**:

   - Learn how to define objects with readonly properties that prevent reassignment.
   - Example of defining an employee object with `readonly` properties.

5. **Type Aliases**:

   - Understand how to create reusable custom types with Type Aliases.
   - Example of defining and using `EmployeeType` across the codebase.

6. **Union Types**:

   - Learn how to use union types to allow variables to have multiple types.
   - Example of a function that accepts both `number` and `string`.

7. **Intersection Types**:

   - Explore how intersection types combine multiple types into one.
   - Example of creating a `UIWidget` that combines both `Draggable` and `Resizable` types.

8. **Literal Types**:

   - Understand how to use literal types to restrict variables to specific values.
   - Examples of using exact values for types like `Quantity` and `Sizes`.

9. **Nullable Types**:

   - Learn how to define variables that can be `null` or `undefined` in addition to other types.
   - Example of a function handling nullable and undefined values.

10. **Optional Chaining**:

    - Explore how to safely access object properties that may not exist using optional chaining (`?.`).

11. **Optional Call Operator**:
    - Learn how to conditionally call a function only if it exists using the optional call operator.
